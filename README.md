# straneo-codeshare

Trying to use a collaborative repo for sharing code developed within the group -- work in progress to determine whether this makes sense or there is a better way to collect useful code developed by different people.

Links to external repos that are useful/relevant:
- [Sermilik Gridded Hydrography](https://github.com/a1roth/sermilik_gridded_hydrography) by Aurora Roth
  - Code and data for Sermilik Fjord gridded hydrography using objective mapping method (for 2025 ESSD paper)
- [Fjords GRL 2022](https://github.com/donaldaslater/fjords_GRL_2022) by Donald Slater
  - Greenland fjord data and analysis code, including 1-D buoyant plume model in Matlab
  - Python version of plume model developed by Natalie McGee to be included in this repo?
