# straneo-codeshare

Trying to use a collaborative repo for sharing code developed within the group -- work in progress to determine whether this makes sense or there is a better way to collect useful code developed by different people.

Links to external repos that are useful/relevant:
- [Sermilik Gridded Hydrography](https://github.com/a1roth/sermilik_gridded_hydrography) by Aurora Roth
  - Code and data for Sermilik Fjord gridded hydrography using objective mapping method (for 2025 ESSD paper)
- [Fjords GRL 2022](https://github.com/donaldaslater/fjords_GRL_2022) by Donald Slater
  - Greenland fjord data and analysis code, including 1-D buoyant plume model in Matlab
  - Python version of plume model developed by Natalie McGee to be included in this repo?
- [Sermilik Icebergs Paper](https://github.com/kykinne/SermilikIcebergsPaperCode) by Kylie Kinne
  - These files generate the figures in Kinne et al., 2025: "The Seasonality of Greenland Iceberg Melt and its Influences on Fjord Properties and Dynamics."
- [Relative Roles JGR 2024](https://github.com/bob-sanchez/Relative_Roles_JGR24) by Robert Sanchez
  - Generate figures in [Bobby's 2024 JGR paper](https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1029/2023JC020492).
